# Reactive time for Hookless

Reactive time as implemented in classes [`ReactiveInstant`](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/javadocs/time/com.machinezoo.hookless.time/com/machinezoo/hookless/time/ReactiveInstant.html) and [`ReactiveDuration`](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/javadocs/time/com.machinezoo.hookless.time/com/machinezoo/hookless/time/ReactiveDuration.html)
is a [reactive adapter](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/adapters) for Java's
[`Instant`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Instant.html)
and [`Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html) classes.
Reactive time acts as a reactive data source that continuously changes.
Hookless implementation of reactive time is smart enough to wake up reactive computation only when relevant time threshold is reached.
This allows Hookless to provide reactive time with millisecond resolution (or better, depending on platform) with little overhead.

## Status

Experimental. [Stagean](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/) is used to track progress on class and method level.
